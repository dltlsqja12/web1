<h1>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h1>
<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system
where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
(URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext,
and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the WWW are transferred
via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software
application called a web browser and are published by a software application called
a web server.</p>
